# Spam Detector System
## Overview
Welcome to the Spam Detector System project! This repository houses a machine learning solution designed to identify and classify emails as either spam or non-spam. Leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms, the system aims to enhance email filtering and improve user experience.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a curated dataset containing a diverse set of emails labeled as spam or non-spam. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features, handle text data, and transform it into a format suitable for machine learning models.

## Models
The machine learning model explored and implemented for spam detection is Naive Bayes. Model selection is based on performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring a robust evaluation of the models' effectiveness in differentiating between spam and legitimate emails.
